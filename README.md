# Drawing application for Android OS

A drawing application was created to explore the creation of custom views. There are two non-standard views used here:
* custom canvas on which drawing is performed;
* custom tools panel that supports adding an unlimited number of different items. Includes a *"parent" panel* for selecting a tool and *"child" panels*, each of which contains individual options for configuring canvas parameters.
